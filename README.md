## 📖 Our Story: A 2-Year Journey

### The Challenge
We started with a simple dream: **Help people find buses easily across West Bengal.** But the journey was far from simple. We spent **2 years** hunting through every possible website, government databases, and transportation portals to gather accurate bus route data.

### The Hunt for Data
- 🔍 **Extensive Web Mining**: Crawled through government websites and public databases
- 📚 **Data Collection**: Manually verified bus routes, schedules, and operator information
- ⚖️ **Legal Ethics**: Maintained distance from private websites to avoid legal complications
- 🏛️ **Government Sources**: Focused on official government transportation data (WBTC, SBSTC, NBSTC)

### The Reality Check
**⚠️ Data Disclaimer:** The government databases we accessed haven't been updated since 2023. While we cross-verified information from multiple sources, some data might have discrepancies. **We do NOT guarantee 100% accuracy** and encourage users to verify with official sources before planning journeys.

### The Victory
With the invaluable help of **SOUMITRA DAS** (our co-developer and tireless data research partner), we managed to build a working solution that brings bus navigation to the fingertips of West Bengalis. It wasn't easy, but we gave our **100%** to make this happen! 💪
